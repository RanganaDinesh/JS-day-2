    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Day - 2 interview questions</h1>
    <h2>1.What is creation phase and execution phase?</h2>
    <pre>
        Compiler runs through the entire code for 2 time before actually executing the code, and generates a Global Execution
         context , inside this we have two phases creation phase and execution phase.
        
        <span> Creation Phase </span>
         1. In the first run, It picks all function declarations and stores them in memory with their reference. 
         2. In the second run, It picks all variables and assign undefined to them. In the event of a conflict between variable and function declaration name then that variable is ignored.

         <span>Execution Phase</span> 
         1. Variables assigned with values given in code at the time of initialization. 
         2. Functions executed
    </pre>
    <h2>2.What are objects in javascript?</h2>
    <pre>
        In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is called a property. The key of a property can be a string. And the value of a property
         can be any value, e.g., a string, a number, an array, and even a function. JavaScript provides you with many ways to create an object. The most commonly used one is to use the object
          literal notation. The following example creates an empty object using the object literal notation: let empty = {};

          example :
          let person = {
             firstName: 'Dinesh',
              lastName: 'karthik
              ' };
              console.log(person)
    </pre>
    <h2>3.What are function constructors?</h2>
    <pre>
        A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword.
         We have multiple constructor functions like Function constructor for functions, Object constructor function for objects, Array constructor function for arrays
        examples:
        function person(){
            this.name="Dinesh",
            this.age=23
            }
            let details= new person()
            console.log(details.name+" "+"is"+" "+details.age)
            
    </pre>
    <h2>4.Explain prototypes?</h2>
    <pre>
        Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype
         is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype. 
         The JavaScript prototype property allows you to add new properties to object constructors:
         examples:
         function personInfo(name,age,language){
            this.name=name;
            this.age=age;
            this.language=language;
          }
          personInfo.prototype.rollno=7
          const details=new personInfo("dinesh",23,"telugu")
          console.log(details,details.rollno)
          out put //
    </pre>
    <h2>5.What is prototype chain</h2>
    <pre>
        Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language. The prototype on object instance is available 
        through Object.getPrototypeOf(object) or proto property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through Object.prototype. 
        Suppose we have an array fruits
         let fruits=["Apple", "Orange"];
    </pre>
    <h2>6.Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</h2>
    <pre>
        examples:
        function Employee(name, age, gender, id) { 
            this.name = name;
             this.age = age; 
             
             this.gender = gender;
              this.id = id;
            
            }; function Developer(name, age, gender, id, specialization) { 
                // Calling Employee constructor 
                function Employee.call(this, name, age, gender, id); 
                // Adding a new parameter this.specialization = specialization; }// Creating objects
                 let Employee1 = new Employee("Suraj", 28, "Male", 564);
                  let Developer1 = new Developer("Karishma", 31, "Female", 345, "Frontend Developer");
                   console.log(Employee1); 
                 console.log(Developer1);

    </pre>
    <h2>7.What are callbacks?</h2>
    <pre>
        A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
         Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function
         function person(name,callback){
            console.log("hi"+" "+ name)
            callback()
          }
          function person1(){
           console.log("how are you")
          }
          person("Dinesh",person1);
    </pre>
